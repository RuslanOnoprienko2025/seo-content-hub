Yes, mobile browsers accommodate client-side converters identically to desktop browsers. Launch the converter in Safari (iOS) or Chrome (Android), select files from your photo library, and save converted PNG files back to your device.

Mobile conversion works particularly well for WebP screenshots captured on Android devices, enabling immediate PNG conversion for sharing via messaging apps or email that don't accommodate WebP attachments.

### How much file size increase should I expect?

PNG files typically exceed WebP files because of less efficient compression:

- **Photographic images**: 2-3x larger (WebP 500 KB → PNG 1-1.5 MB)
- **Graphics with transparency**: 1.5-2x larger
- **Simple logos**: Minimal difference or sometimes smaller as PNG

Images containing complex gradients and millions of colors demonstrate the largest size increases. Simple graphics with few colors sometimes compress more efficiently as PNG than lossless WebP.

### Should I delete original WebP files after conversion?

This depends on your requirements:

**Delete WebP files if**: You're certain you won't require the smaller file sizes for web use. Storage space proves limited and PNG format satisfies all your needs.

**Keep WebP files if**: You might require web-optimized versions later. You're archiving both formats for maximum flexibility. Storage space isn't constrained.

Many professionals maintain both formats: WebP for web publishing and PNG for editing, print, and archival purposes.
